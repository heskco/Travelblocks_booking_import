### How to run the booking import microservices

We need to have docker installed previously.

```
$ bash < kraken.sh
```

This will basically install every microservice and setup the docker swarm cluster

and deploy every docker service in the swarm.

To monitor the cluster in a graphic mode we can go and visit the following url: `http://192.168.99.100:9000`

and this will give us the rancherOS web interface.
